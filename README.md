 # MonoGame Tetris

This is a tetris game made in C# using the monogame framework as a base, without any external game engines. It also used HLSL for shader code.
This project was done as a personal, rapid prototyping personal challenge and completed in 3 days. All commits beyond the basic gameplay are quality of life features I've added for fun 
including glow effects for cleared pieces, and drawing the game in monochrome when paused.
In the future the game might get "BLOB" themed artwork and themes to better suit the name of the repository.
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the monogame framework installed on your computer, if not then the project will not run. In the future I may include a pre-compiled executable in the project that
testers may run without compiling.

# Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/monogame-project.git

    Open the project in  Visual Studio

    Build and run the project.

# Project Structure
